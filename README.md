# User-Experience-Design

## Site Goals

Astro Community aims to unite space enthusiasts in a thriving online platform, fostering knowledge exchange, stimulating discussions, and encouraging the exploration of the wonders of the universe. My goal is to create an engaging, supportive space where members can connect, learn, and share their passion for the cosmos.

## Agile Planning

This project was developed following agile principles, with a series of four sprints. Each feature was prioritized and labeled as either "must-have," "should-have," or "could-have." We began by implementing the must-have features, followed by the should-have features, and finally addressed the could-have features if time and resources permitted. This approach ensured the delivery of a comprehensive website, with optional enhancements added based on capacity.

Our Kanban board, created using GitHub Projects, facilitated project management and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/users/PrezBala/projects/1/views/1). For more detailed information on each task, simply click on the respective view.

## Structure

### Astro Community Features - USER

Navbar

User story - As a user I want to be able to navigate easily around the site easily from any devise

Navigation Menu

When the user is not logged in the navigation bar links to the Sign In, Sign Up page and the Home Page and the '+' Button is not visible

![Animated GIF](static/assets/gif/nousers.gif)

Once the user has signed in the navigation menu changes to Log out and Home with the '+' appearing, allow the user to create a new post.

![Animated GIF](static/assets/gif/user.gif)

On smaller devices, i ensured the NavBar shows correctly with all text visible.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/mobileloguser.png">

### Astro Community Features - ADMIN

Once the user has signed in the navigation menu changes to Log out and Home with the '+' appearing, allow the user to create a new post.

![Animated GIF](static/assets/gif/admin.gif)

I've designed an Admin interface that provides the administrator with the ability to edit, delete, and approve user-submitted posts.

Administrators will possess unique authorizations that standard users do not have access to. This includes an exclusive 'Admin' page accessible through the forum's frontpage navigation bar. On this page, administrators can view all posts and have the option to edit, delete, and authorize comments for public viewing on the website. Additionally, the design has been enhanced to ensure clarity and aesthetic appeal.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/updatebasicmodel.png">


### Home Page

- User Story - As a user, I want to easily view the main categories and navigate to the relevant one.

The main page features an engaging .mp4 video of the moon with clouds circulating, emphasizing the space theme of the website.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/moonimage.png">

A search function is included, allowing users to look for topics of interest. If a match is found, users will be directed to the search results page.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/searchbox.png">

Once logged in, users can click the '+' symbol to create a new post by entering a title, content, and selecting a category. Tags can also be added to improve search accuracy.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/plus.png">

Forum stats are displayed, showcasing the total post count, details of the latest post, and the user who created it.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/forumstats.png">

### Footer

- User Story: As site owner, I want to share my name within the footer.

The Footer has been added to the bottom of the site.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/footer.png">

### Browse Posts

- User Story: As a user who is not logged in, I want to have the ability to explore forum posts created by other users.

Even without logging in, anyone can access the website to browse posts, navigate between categories, and read through all posts, comments, and replies

### Search

- User Story: As a user, I want to search for topics of interest to discover if other users have shared similar thoughts or comments.

Upon entering their search query, users will be directed to a search results page displaying relevant content, or a message indicating no results were found.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/searchresult.png">


### Log In Log Out Sign Up

User Stories
- As a new user, I want a straightforward and intuitive signup process.
- As a returning user, I want an effortless login experience.
- As a user, I want to safely and easily log out of the site.
- As a developer, I want to standardize the style of all forms and ensure they look good on various devices.

Users can seamlessly sign in and out using consistently styled forms and confirmation pages.

User Stories:

### Create Post

- User Story: As a user, I want to effortlessly share my questions or theories on the site so that I can exchange ideas with others.

Upon logging in, users can create their own posts using forms designed with Crispy Forms.

The image below showcases the mobile view, illustrating how the forms adapt to a smaller screen, ensuring a user-friendly experience on mobile devices.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/phonesize.png">

### Profile Picture

- User Story: As a user, I want the ability to upload a profile picture for the new account I've just created.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/profilepic.png">

### Engagement

User Stories

- As a user, I want to see the level of engagement for each post, which is represented by clear images within each category page.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/postengagement.png">

When a user creates a new post and it is approved by the site admin, the engagement will be displayed as '0 Engagement Topic.'

As users comment or reply within that post, the engagement indicator will be updated accordingly.

The image below represents a new post with no engagement from other users, and thus, a sad face status image is displayed to signify this lack of interaction.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/0engage.png">

In contrast, the image below demonstrates a scenario where a user comments on the post, resulting in an updated status image displaying a book symbol, which indicates a level of 'low engagement.'

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/1engage.png">

# Wireframes

Category Selection and Posts.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/wireframe3.png">

# Database

The system is configured to grant administrators CRUD functionality upon signing in. Both the administrator and any designated moderator can approve, remove, edit, and close posts through the admin function, which is exclusively viewable and accessible by the admin. This feature is demonstrated in the accompanying screenshot.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/adminpost.png">

Additionally, the Django admin page can be accessed for more sophisticated modifications, such as creating categories, assigning points to users, and so on.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/admin.png">


# Security

Views were safeguarded using Django's view mixin, UserPassesTestMixin. A test function was implemented to employ the mixin and ensure that the user has the necessary authorization to access the page. Moreover, an else statement is used in detail.html to restrict unauthorized users from commenting or replying to posts unless approved by the administrator or moderators.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/userlock.png">

Environment variables were stored in an env.py file for security purposes to ensure no secret keys, api keys or sensitive information were added to the repository.  These variables were added to ElephantSQL config vars within the project

# Design

## Colour Scheme

To maintain the space theme of the website, I searched for a suitable color palette using Colorswall [https://colorswall.com/] ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

## Imagery  

The hero video featured on the website is an .mp4 file depicting the moon with clouds swirling around it. This captivating visual was found through a Google image search using video filters.

## Icons
The icons on the Forum page were sourced from Font Awesome [https://fontawesome.com/]

# Testing

## Functional Testing

### Navigation Links

Testing was performed on on all navigation links throughout the site.  I achieved this by clicking on each link to ensure it went to the correct place.

Navbar 'Burger' Menu => Expands Navbar to signin.html, signup.html and index.html
Home page => index.html
Sign In => signin.html
Signup => signup.html
Logout => index.html

Admin only FRONT access

Admin  => admindashboard.html

### Sign Up Page

Testing was taken out to ensure a user could sign up to the website.
Steps:
- Navigate to [AstroCommunity](https://astro-community.herokuapp.com/)
- Navigate to the Sign Up page.
- Enter User Name and Password
- Enter Full name, Bio and upload profile picture
- Click Update

Expected outcome: The user is redirected to the home page, and the navbar displays the log out and home options along with the '+' symbol.
Actual outcome: The user is indeed redirected to the home page, and the navbar updates to show the log out and home options as well as the '+' symbol.

### Log out Page

Testing was taken out to ensure a user could log out of the website.
Steps:
- Navigate to Log Out page
- Click Confirm button

Expected outcome: Upon completing the action, the user is redirected to the homepage, and the navbar should only display options for signing in, signing up, and returning home. The '+' icon should not be present.

Actual outcome: The expected outcome was met, and the user was redirected to the homepage with the navbar displaying only options for signing in, signing up, and returning home. The '+' icon was not present.

### Log in

Testing was taken out to ensure a user could log in to the website.
Steps:
- Navigate to [AstroCommunity](https://astro-community.herokuapp.com/)
- Navigate to Sign In page
- Enter User Name and Password
- Click Sign in

Expected outcome: Upon completing the action, the user is redirected to the homepage, and the navbar should only display options for logging out and returning home. The '+' icon should be present.

Actual outcome: The expected outcome was met, and the user was redirected to the homepage with the navbar displaying only options for logging out and returning home. The '+' icon was present.

### Create New Post

Testing was carried out to ensure the user could create a new post.

Assuming user is already logged in
Steps:
- Navigate to the home page
- Click the '+' symbol
- Complete form
  - Title
  - Content
  - Categories
  - Tags
- Click Save

  Expected outcome: If all fields are filled in correctly, the user will be redirected to the home page. The new post will appear for the administrator or forum moderator to review, and they can decide whether or not to authorize it to appear publicly. This function serves to prevent spamming and ensure that all content is reviewed by the administrator or moderators before it is made public on the forum.

  ### Delete A Comment or Reply

Testing was conducted with both super user and standard user roles. The goal was to verify that super users have the ability to delete any comments and replies posted by users on the forum, while standard users can only remove their own comments and replies, and not those of other standard users.


Steps:
- Login as super user (Admin)
- Navigate to category of interest
- Navigate to a post
- Make a comment and reply to the comment
- Login as standard user (user:Wizard in the screenshot below)
- Navigate to the same page
- Make another comment and reply to the main post
- Check visibility of what can be deleted and also test deletion.
- Logged back in as superuser and check Front and backend to ensure data removed correctly.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/deletetest.png">

  Expected outcome: A superuser has the capability to remove all comments and replies within the forum, while a standard user can only delete their own posts and responses.

### Edit Close and Delete a post

Administrators have the ability to edit or delete any user post through the admin page, which can be accessed via the front-end interface (for user posts only) and the Django Admin page. This comprehensive administration coverage includes creating and editing categories, assigning points to users, and managing tasks such as deleting users and posts.

Assuming the administrator is logged in
Steps:
- Navigate to the admin page
- The administrator can select to either delete, edit,close or approve a post (button)

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/adminpage.png">

Expected outcome:  The user will be redirected back to admin main page.

The outcome was as expected.

### Comment on a post

Initially, I examined the comment section while the user was logged out. 

As anticipated, there was no option to submit a comment, but rather a message indicating that the user must log in to post, accompanied by a link within the text.

If the user is logged in:

Steps

- Navigate to a post within any of the categories
- Click on comment and select submit
- User comment will appear below

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/commenttest.png">

Expected outcome: The comment will appear below the original post.

The outcome was as expected.

### Reply on a post

If the user is logged in:

Steps

- Navigate to a post within any of the categories
- Click on reply to an existing post with comments and select submit
- User response will appear below
- User response text box will appear shifted to the right to differentiate from standard comment messages.

Expected outcome: When a response is posted, it will appear beneath the user's comment, with the entire response field indented to the right.

The outcome was as expected.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/replytest.png">

### Closed post 

If a post is closed, no users will be able to comment and reply until the post is opened up again by the administrator.

Steps

- Navigate to a post with the padlock symbol under status

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/closedpost.png">

- Users will encounter a message indicating that the topic is closed and will not have the ability to comment or reply until the post is reopened.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/closedpost2.png">

The outcome was as expected.

### User test

I enlisted my wife's help to test the website's functionality. She was instructed to register for an account and create a new post. Moreover, she evaluated the search feature and the engagement viewer to confirm that they updated properly.

## Accessibility

I utilized the [Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool for assistance with accessibility testing. All pages displayed zero errors.

However, there are Alerts related to underlined text and a contrast issue. Despite these alerts, multiple user testing sessions have confirmed the clarity of the content.

## Validator Testing

All pages were tested using the [w3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/). At first, there were a few errors, such as missing closing tags and a < p> tag incorrectly placed within a < span>.

All identified issues were resolved, and the pages passed the validator without any errors.

As the HTML files used Django's template language, the HTML code had to be extracted from the live web page by right-clicking and choosing "View Source." This code was then copied and pasted into the validator for verification.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/htmlcheck.png">

## PP8 Validator

Since pep8online.com was unavailable, I used Flake8 to identify and fix errors in the Python files within the project. These errors primarily consisted of misalignments and typographical errors.

I also utilized an online Python checker that I discovered through a Google search. [Python Checker](https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html)

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/PYTHON1.png">


I've also employed the Code Institute's CI Python Linter validator, which returned no errors, as demonstrated below.


<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/urlspy.png">

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/viewspy.png">


## Java Validator

All pages were tested using the [Jshint Validator  ](https://jshint.com/). No errors appeared.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/JAVACHECK.png">


## Lighthouse Report

Initially, the Lighthouse report indicated a low score for best practices and also indicated where i can make imporvements.
To improve the score, I added accessible names to specific buttons and made sure links were crawlable.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/error1.png">

I've fixed these issues by adding a void element to the a href attribute for each of the highlighted instances.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/error1v1.png">

In the Lighthouse report, two additional issues were identified: the buttons are missing accessible names, and there is an insufficient contrast ratio between the background and foreground elements.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/error2.png">

I've added an arial label to the text highlighted which resolved that issue.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/error2v2.png">

I made adjustments to the text color to make it more visible for users. This change not only resolved the error but also improved the overall score.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/error2v1.png">

After implementing these changes, the score increased to 100, resulting in high ratings across all four criteria.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/lighthouse.png">


# Responsiveness

I evaluated the website's responsiveness on all devices with widths of 320px and above. The testing was conducted on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

To accomplish this, I utilized developer tools and resized the website down to 320px.

As anticipated, there were no issues with responsiveness.

# Bugs

- There was an issue that prevented users' profile pictures from being displayed within the forum page, as illustrated below.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/noprofilepic.png">

I've added the below code within the urls.py for static/media root which resolved the issue.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/profilepiccode.png">

- An issue arose when users who were not logged in could still comment on forum posts. To resolve this, a check was added to ensure that the request user is authenticated before allowing them to comment. This solution was also applied to reply comments and closed posts, preventing users from commenting or replying when a post is closed.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/replyissue.png">

- The search function was not producing any results due to a typo in the search.html file. After identifying and correcting the error, the search function was tested and successfully displayed the relevant results.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/searchresult.png">

- I faced a problem where a standard user could delete administrator comments within any forum section. I realized that I had used 'request.user.is_authenticated' instead of the correct conditional statement, 'request.user == comment.user.user or request.user.is_staff'. After rectifying this mistake, the functionality worked as intended.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/deletecommenterror.png">

- After deploying my project on Heroku, I faced a problem and sought assistance from student support. The root cause of the issue turned out to be the background image URL I had used within style.css. To resolve it, I linked the URL directly to the image on Cloudinary, as demonstrated in the following image.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project4/blob/main/static/assets/images/urlerror.png">
